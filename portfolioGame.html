          <h2>Witchone IO</h2>
          <p class="color-contrast-medium">From a simple <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/INAT/comments/qudu6t/revshare_hobby_project_our_team_is_looking_for_a/">Reddit post</a>, i joined an awesome Team from several people from multiple Countries (German, US, Brazil, and Korea). The project is well managed. Since its an Online Game, we split our job into joblets. </p>

          <p class="color-contrast-medium">I was responsible for <a href="https://www.photonengine.com/pun">PUN</a> enhancement, and WebGL build. The reason is, we want to show this off to several people before we launch it. However, since the code is too long and several parts are conflicted (because we are using <a href="https://www.fmod.com/unity">FMOD</a>). So I re-arrange the legacy code and make sure that there are no versioning issue again, because WebGL and FMOD has their own music library. That's where the conflict was.</p>

          <p class="color-contrast-medium">After all, this is a long-term project and still under development. And I hope I can keep contributing until we release this game.</p>

          <p class="color-contrast-medium">Its been a while since I develop my latest Game. I Got this idea when I randomly choose Game Jam from <a href="https://itch.io/jams">Itch.io</a> page. I like to play Story rich games. However I haven't made one yet. Thats why I decide to Start creating it. Since I still have the My previous 2D templates, I am planning to used it. I used <a href="https://yarnspinner.dev/">Yarn Spinner</a> for unity to support the story-driven experience. It is conveninet since Yarn Spinner is also support player's decision making in the middle of the story. Currently it is still in development right now. Since I live in Seoul, I want to make a story which taken Place in Seoul, This is the sneak peak of the first chapter that I have made.</p>

I teamed up with 4 French and 1 American dudes. Between 48 hour we managed to finish our games. I am responsible for the "Rope/Leash" feature. If you right click the player, it will glow and able to fetch the enemy. It is awesome because our teams are well prepared 1 week before the jam start. Sadly, because limited time for testing, this is only available on Windows</p>

          <h2>Hello AR</h2>
          <p class="color-contrast-medium">Its almost end of my Master Degree. Since I have background in Unity VR, I want to apply several VR Game Studios. One of them are based on Seoul, Korea. I still remember last time I develop Unity AR using Vuforia Engine in 2019. And we have to prepare a solid marker to make it appeared in user's device. Recently, <a href="https://unity.com/unity/features/arfoundation">AR Foundation</a> existed. This Company want me to test my ability about it. So here are several videos about it</p>

          <h2>Sandwich!!!</h2>
          <p class="color-contrast-medium">This time, I am creating a "Casual Game". TL;DR; Simple game that does not require any knowledge. I got an idea to use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.popcore.makesandwich&hl=en&gl=US">Sandwich!</a> just for exploration. The game is simply about how to make a sandwich by swiping the phone's screen. However, since I am busy with my Thesis defense, so i discard the animation. I was thinking to use <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.tiny@0.13/manual/module-tweens.html">Tweens Module</a> From unity. Maybe I'll work on it later.</p>

          <h2>Go Back Bullet</h2>
          <p class="color-contrast-medium">The previous team seems busy. We already plan to create new games, but no follow up though. Since my workload is not heavy enough, i tried to join <a href="https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-4">Brackeys Game jam 2020.2</a> instead as a solo developer <a href="https://mhr-171.itch.io/gobackbullet">alone</a>. At the beginning, i am team up with Syrian boy (AG45 as seen on discord). He said that he is 18 Year's old, young enough right. But in the middle of game developing, he admit that he is bossy and don't want me to keep ask him anymore. So, i finish this game by myself including the assets too. This is the first time for me to create full functional game mostly by myself. Even there is only one level.</p>
